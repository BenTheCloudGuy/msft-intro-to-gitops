# Lab Guide #

This step in the lab focuses on setting up the foundational Terraform configuration files and defining the necessary variables for deploying infrastructure. By creating and populating files such as lab.tfvars, users provide input values for resource naming, tagging, and application server configurations. These configurations ensure modularity, scalability, and flexibility in managing infrastructure as code. After this we can 

## Setting Terraform Files ##

This step in the lab focuses on setting up the foundational files for Terraform configuration. Navigate to the Terraform directory and create the necessary files (data.tf, locals.tf, main.tf, outputs.tf, provider.tf, and variables.tf) to structure the infrastructure as code. These files serve specific purposes, such as defining data sources, local values, providers, variables, and outputs, ensuring a modular and organized approach to managing infrastructure. 

1. Set current directory to ```/workspaces/lab-api/infra/terraform```: 
    ```sh
    cd /workspaces/lab-api/infra/terraform
    ```

2. Create Terraform file: 
    ```sh
    touch data.tf locals.tf main.tf outputs.tf provider.tf variables.tf
    ```

    The Current Repo Layout should look like this: 
    ```sh
    .

## Add Content to the files ##

This step in the lab will guide you in creating and understanding the key Terraform configuration files required to deploy the WebAPI Demo App infrastructure. Each file serves a specific purpose in defining and managing the infrastructure. For example, ```data.tf``` retrieves existing Azure resources and user credentials, while ```provider.tf``` specifies the providers and backend configuration for Terraform. By carefully following these steps, you will gain a deeper understanding of how Terraform organizes and executes infrastructure as code, enabling them to build modular, scalable, and maintainable configurations.

> **NOTE**  
>  Take your time and read through what you are copying over and try and understand what each configuration item is doing. 

---

### provider.tf ### 

This step introduces the ```provider.tf``` file, which is essential for configuring the providers and backend that Terraform will use to manage infrastructure. The file specifies the required providers, such as azapi, azurerm, and random, along with their respective versions to ensure compatibility and functionality for managing Azure resources and generating random values. 

Additionally, the backend **"azurerm"** block configures Terraform to store its state file in an Azure Storage Account you setup using the AzCLI in the previous Lab, allowing for collaboration among team members and maintaining state consistency across multiple users. When testing locally it is okay to keep the statefile local, but in all other environments, it should be remotely stored and secured. 

>**NOTE**  
> The Terraform State file needs to be secured as it contains sensative data used in the creation of the environment. Treat this like you would your own sensative data and limit who has access to read the file from the remote state. 

Copy the following into your ```provider.tf```.
```sh
terraform {
    required_version = "~> 1.11.0"

    required_providers {
        terraform {
        required_version = "~> 1.11.0"

        required_providers {
        azapi = {
            source  = "azure/azapi"
            version = "~>2.3.0"
        }
        azurerm = {
            source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
            version = "~>4.25.0"
        }
        random = {
            source  = "hashicorp/random"
            version = "~>3.7.0"
        }
    }

    backend "azurerm" {
        resource_group_name  = "<your-resource-group>"
        storage_account_name = "<your-storage-account>"
        container_name       = "tfstate"
        key                  = "gitops.tfstate"
        tenant_id            = "<your-tenant-id>"
        use_azuread_auth     = true
    }
}

provider "azurerm" {
    features {}
    subscription_id = "<your-subscription-id>"
}
```
> **NOTE**  
> In this step, the ```provider.tf``` file specifies the required providers (azapi, azurerm, and random) along with their versions, ensuring compatibility and functionality for managing Azure resources and generating random values. Additionally, the backend "azurerm" block configures Terraform to store its state file in an Azure Storage Account, enabling collaboration and ensuring state consistency across multiple users.

---

### data.tf ###

This step focuses on updating the ```data.tf``` file to define two essential data sources in Terraform. The first data source, **azurerm_client_config**, retrieves the current user's Azure credentials, ensuring that Terraform can authenticate and interact with Azure resources. The second data source, **azurerm_resource_group**, references an existing Azure resource group that you created using the AzCLI, allowing Terraform to manage resources within it. 

>**NOTE**  
> Data Import is something that you will commonly have to do when working with various existing infrastructure that is managed else where. Typlically you would create the ResourceGroup(s) as part of the Platform you are deploying vs referencing an existing one. 

Copy the following into your ```data.tf``` file. 
```sh
# Import Current User Credentials
data "azurerm_client_config" "current" {
    provider = azurerm
}

# Import Existing Resource Group created using the Azure CLI
data "azurerm_resource_group" "existing" {
    name = "rg-${initials}${var.random_string}" 
}
```
---

### locals.tf ###

The locals.tf file in Terraform is used to define local values, which are named expressions that simplify and reuse complex or repetitive values in your configuration. In this step, the locals.tf file defines a resourceTags local value that merges predefined tags (var.tags) with a dynamically generated DeploymentUTC tag. 
    
Copy the following into your ```locals.tf```.
```sh
locals {
    ## Add Current Date/Time tag
    resourceTags = merge(
        var.tags,
        {
            DeploymentUTC = formatdate("YYYY-MM-DD'T'hh:mm:ssZ", timestamp()),
        }
    )
}
```
---

### variables.tf ###

This step introduces the ```variables.tf``` file, which is used to define input variables that make Terraform configurations flexible and reusable. These variables allow users to customize their infrastructure by providing values for specific parameters, such as a random string for resource uniqueness (random_string), user initials for naming conventions (initials), and a map of tags for resource metadata (tags). Additionally, the appServersConfig variable defines an object to configure application servers, including details like the VM name prefix, count, admin username, availability zones, SSH key path, and VM SKU. 

>**NOTE**  
> You can use the {default = "value"} property if you want to have a default value and not have to pass the variable in at runtime. I typically steer clear of "default" values. Either pass it in as part of the module or use the locals.tf to create the values dynamically to be passed in at runtime. 
>
> Another thing that is recommended is keeping the number of variables required to a minimum. Again use dynamic configurations whenever possible. 


Copy the following into your ```variables.tf```:
```sh
variable "random_string" {
    description = "A random string to be appended to the resource group name for uniqueness."
    type        = string
}

variable "initials" {
    description = "The initials to be used for the resource group name."
    type        = string
}

variable "tags" {
    description = "A map of tags to be applied to the resources."
    type        = map(string)
    default     = {}
}

variable "appServersConfig" {
    description = "Configuration for App Servers"
    type = object({
        vmnameprefix  = string
        vmcount       = number
        adminUsername = string
        zones         = list(string)
        key_path      = string
        vm_sku        = string
    })
}
```
---

### lab.tfvars ###

The lab.tfvars file is used to define input variables for the Terraform configuration. It provides specific values for variables such as naming conventions, tags, and application server configurations. 

Copy the following into your ```lab.tfvars```
```sh
# Lab Configurations
initials      = "<your-initials>"
random_string = "<your-random-string>"

## Tag Vars
tags = {
  "Owner"       = "<your-name>"
  "Environment" = "GitOps Lab"
}

## App Server Confiugurations
appServersConfig = {
    vmnameprefix    = "webapp"
    vmcount         = 2
    adminUsername   = "labAdmin"
    zones           = ["3"]
    key_path        = "/home/vscode/.ssh/docker.pub"
    vm_sku          = "Standard_D2s_v6"
}
```
--- 

### outputs.tf ###

The ```outputs.tf``` file in Terraform is used to define outputs that provide critical information about the infrastructure after it has been provisioned. These outputs make it easier to access and reference key details, such as the resource group name (ResourceGroupName), Azure region (AzureRegion), and the name of the Azure Bastion host (BastionName). 

Additionally, it includes outputs for the private IP addresses of the virtual machines (vm_private_ips), the public IP address of the load balancer (lb_public_ip), and the resource IDs of the virtual machines (vm_resourceId). By defining these outputs, users can easily retrieve and use these values in other configurations, scripts, or documentation, streamlining the management and integration of the deployed infrastructure.

>**NOTE**  
> A common technique in building out automated pipelines is to leverage the Terraform Outputs to gather information from the deployment for use in other stages of the build. 


Copy the following into your ```outputs.tf```:
```sh
output "ResourceGroupName" {
    value = data.azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
}

output "AzureRegion" {
    value = data.azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
}

output "BastionName" {
    value = module.azure_bastion.name
}

output "vm_private_ips" {
    description = "PrivateIP addresses of the VMs"
    value = [
        for vm in module.webappServers : vm.network_interfaces.nic0.private_ip_address
    ]
}

output "lb_public_ip" {
    value = azurerm_public_ip.webapp_lb_pip.ip_address
}

output "vm_resourceId" {
    value = [
        for vm in module.webappServers : vm.resource_id
    ]
} 
```
---

### main.tf ###

This step in the lab focuses on building the ```main.tf``` file, which serves as the central configuration file for defining and orchestrating the deployment of infrastructure resources. Users will add modules and resources to create a virtual network, configure a network security group, deploy an Azure Bastion host, set up a load balancer, and provision virtual machines. Each section of the file is modular and reusable, leveraging Terraform modules and resource blocks. Each section is broken down around a common solution or technology. 


- The below code blocks demonstrates the use of Azure Verified Modules (AVMs) to import core modules into a Terraform configuration. These modules are pre-built, reusable components designed to simplify and standardize infrastructure deployment on Azure. Here's a breakdown of what each module does and its purpose:

    #### Module "naming" ####
    ```sh 
    module "naming" {
        source  = "Azure/naming/azurerm"
        version = "~> 0.4"
    }
    ```
    >**NOTE**  
    > This module provides a standardized naming convention for Azure resources. It ensures that resource names follow Azure's best practices, such as adhering to length restrictions and avoiding invalid characters.  
    > Why Use It: Consistent naming conventions improve resource management, readability, and compliance with organizational policies

    >**INFO**  
    > https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/naming/azurerm/latest


    #### Module "Regions ####
    ```sh
    module "regions" {
        source                    = "Azure/avm-utl-regions/azurerm"
        version                   = "0.3.0"
        enable_telemetry          = false
        availability_zones_filter = true
    }
    ```
    >**NOTE**  
    > Purpose: This module helps manage Azure regions and availability zones. It provides functionality to filter and select regions or zones based on specific criteria.  
    > **Why Use It**: Ensures that resources are deployed in regions and zones that meet availability and redundancy requirements.  
    > Key Features:
    >> enable_telemetry: Enables telemetry to track usage and improve the module.  
    >> availability_zones_filter: Filters regions based on the availability of zones.

    #### Module 'vm_sku' ####
    ```sh
    module "vm_sku" {
    source = "Azure/avm-utl-sku-finder/azapi"

        version       = "0.3.0"
        location      = data.azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
        cache_results = false
        vm_filters    = {
            max_vcpus = 2
        }
    }
    ```
    >**NOTE**  
    > Instead of manually searching for and validating VM SKUs, this module automates the process by applying filters and retrieving compatible SKUs for the specified region. It ensures compatiblity by specifying the location, the module ensures that the selected SKU is available in the target Azure region, avoiding deployment errors.  
    > The vm_filters parameter allows users to define constraints (e.g., maximum vCPUs), ensuring that the selected SKU meets performance and cost requirements.  
    > The module is reusable across different configurations and environments, making it easier to maintain and scale infrastructure deployments.

- The Azure/avm-res-network-virtualnetwork/azurerm module is an Azure Verified Module (AVM) used to create and manage a virtual network (VNet) in Azure. This module simplifies the process of defining a VNet and its associated subnets while adhering to Azure best practices.

    #### Module "virtual_network" ####
    ```sh
    # Create Virtual Network
    module "virtual_network" {
    source = "Azure/avm-res-network-virtualnetwork/azurerm"

        address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/24"]
        location            = data.azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
        name                = "vnet-${var.initials}${var.random_string}"
        resource_group_name = data.azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
        tags                = local.resourceTags
        subnets = {
            "subnet1" = {
                name             = "AzureBastionSubnet"
                address_prefixes = ["10.0.0.0/26"]
            }
            "subnet2" = {
                name             = "AppSubnet"
                address_prefixes = ["10.0.0.64/26"]
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    >**NOTE**  
    > Automates the creation of a virtual network and its subnets, reducing the complexity of manual configuration. Adheres to Azure's recommended practices for network design, ensuring scalability, security, and performance. Provides a reusable and modular approach to defining VNets, making it easier to integrate with other Terraform configurations.  

    > - The ```address_space``` parameter specifies the IP address range for the VNet (10.0.0.0/24 in this case).  
    > - The ```location``` parameter ensures the VNet is deployed in the same Azure region as the specified resource group.
    > - The ```tags``` parameter uses local.resourceTags to apply metadata to the VNet and its subnets
    > - The ```subnets``` block allows the creation of multiple subnets within the VNet. Each subnet is defined with a unique name and address prefix:  
    >   - ```subnet1``` is reserved for Azure Bastion with the name AzureBastionSubnet and address prefix 10.0.0.0/26.  
    >   - ```subnet2``` is for application resources with the name AppSubnet and address prefix 10.0.0.64/26.

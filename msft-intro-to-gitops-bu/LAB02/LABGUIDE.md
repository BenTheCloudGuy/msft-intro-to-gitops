### LAB01 ###

In LAB01, you will be introduced to Docker by validating its installation, running your first container, and exploring basic Docker commands. You will pull and run the hello-world container to understand how Docker images and containers work. Additionally, you will learn how to list images, check container statuses, and interact with running containers. The lab concludes with cleaning up unused containers and images to manage system resources effectively, providing a solid foundation for working with Docker.

### LAB02 ###

In LAB02, you will create a custom Docker image for a Node.js web application. This involves setting up the application directory, creating a Dockerfile with instructions to build the image, and using the docker build command to containerize the application. You will verify the image creation and explore its metadata using Docker commands. By the end of this lab, you will have a locally stored custom image ready for deployment.

### LAB03  ###

In LAB03, you will test the custom Docker image by running it as a container locally. You will map the container's port to your local machine, interact with the application through a browser or API client, and verify its functionality. After testing, you will push the image to the GitHub Container Registry, making it accessible for deployment across environments or integration into CI/CD workflows. This lab demonstrates the full lifecycle of building, testing, and sharing a Docker image.

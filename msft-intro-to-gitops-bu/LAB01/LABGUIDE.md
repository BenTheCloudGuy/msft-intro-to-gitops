# LAB01: Introduction to Git #

What You Are Doing:<br>
In these labs, you will create a new repository on GitHub for your Lab API project directly from your terminal using the GitHub CLI (gh), demonstrating the efficiency of GitOps workflows. You will learn how to manage branches, update and format a README.md file, and push changes to a remote repository. Additionally, you will practice creating pull requests, merging changes, and cleaning up your local environment. By the end of these labs, you will have a solid understanding of foundational GitOps practices, including repository management, collaboration, and workflow optimization.

### LAB01 ###

In LAB01, you will learn how to create and manage a new GitHub repository using the GitHub CLI, authenticate with GitHub using a token stored in CodeSpaces Secrets, and clone the repository to your local development environment. You will also practice navigating directories, using Git commands to clone repositories, and integrating a new repository into your Visual Studio Code workspace. By the end of this lab, your workspace will include two directories: msft-intro-to-gitops and lab-api. These foundational skills will prepare you for managing repositories and collaborating effectively in a GitOps workflow.

### LAB02 ###

In LAB02, you will create a new branch in your repository to follow Git best practices by isolating changes from the main branch. In this branch, you will update the default README.md file with meaningful content, such as project details, features, and structure, ensuring your repository is well-documented and ready for collaboration. You will practice staging changes, committing them to your local repository, and pushing them to the remote repository. Additionally, you will troubleshoot common Git issues, such as setting up an upstream branch for pushing changes. By the end of this lab, you will understand how to manage branches, collaborate effectively, and maintain a clean and organized Git workflow.

### LAB03  ###

In LAB03, you will learn how to finalize and merge changes from a feature branch into the main branch using Git and GitHub. You will fix formatting issues in the README.md file, stage and commit the changes, and push them to the remote repository. After verifying the updates, you will create a pull request on GitHub to merge the changes from the create-readme branch into the main branch. You will also explore the pull request process, including reviewing changes, merging, and deleting the feature branch once it is no longer needed. Finally, you will clean up your local environment by pulling the latest changes to the main branch and removing the feature branch locally. By the end of this lab, you will understand how to collaborate effectively using branches, pull requests, and Git workflows.
